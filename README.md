# Speech Classification and Trigger Word Detection using MFCC

This repository contains an implementation of speech classification and trigger word detection using Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC). Speech classification is a vital task in natural language processing (NLP) with applications in voice assistants, transcription services, and emotion recognition systems. Trigger word detection focuses on identifying specific keywords or phrases within continuous audio streams.  
The project was developed as part of a data science project during my Master's studies in Artificial Intelligence.

## Description
- Building dataset tailored for the task.  
- Implementation of MFCC for feature extraction from speech signals.  
- Integration of various machine learning models for speech classification  
- Usage of deep learning sed-to-sed architecture with LSTM for trigger word detection.  
- Evaluation of models performances.

## Original Data set
Tensorflow provides the dataset **"speech_command"** that contains thousands of raw audio files *".wav"*.  
The dataset can be found on Tensorflow website, here : https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/speech_commands    
or on Kaggle website, here : https://www.kaggle.com/c/tensorflow-speech-recognition-challenge/data  
The data need to be downloaded and extracted in the repo directory as "speech command".# Speech-classification-trigger-word-detection-with-MFCC
